####Model Overview:
This two-layer reservoir model was derived from equations for changes in temperature in the epilimnion and hypolimnoin from equations 31.2 and 31.3 in "Surface Water Quality Modeling" (Chapra, 1997, McGraw Hill).Since both temperature and volume change between time steps, we added a *dV/dt* component to each reservoir.
